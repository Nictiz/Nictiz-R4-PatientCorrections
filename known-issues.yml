  ignored issues:
    Communication:
      - message: "Communication.recipient:healthcareProvider: minimum required = 1, but only found 0"
        reason: The referred resources are not included in the pacakge and cannot be resolved, so the Validator cannot match the reference to a slice and wrongly assumes that it is absent.
    Communication.recipient[*]:
      - message: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/dwv-PatientCorrectionsCommunication
        reason: See above.
