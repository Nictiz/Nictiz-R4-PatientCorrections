# Nictiz-R4-PatientCorrections

This repository contains HL7 FHIR R4 compliant profiles and related conformance materials for Patient Corrections (Dutch: Dossierwijzigingsverzoek). Currently in development and therefore not yet suitable for implementation. The FHIR IG, also in draft status, can be found at the [informatiestandaarden wiki](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/MedMij:Vpoc/FHIR_Patient_Corrections).

This repository is maintained by the Dutch National Intitute for ICT in Healthcare (Nictiz).

## Official releases

Resources in this repository should be considered unstable and not suited for immediate implementation. Stable versions will be released using the FHIR package mechanism on [Simplifier](https://simplifier.net/packages). At the moment, no package has been released for the current project.

## Profiling guidelines

The profiling guidelines for this project can be found at the [informatiestandaarden wiki](http://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/FHIR:V1.0_FHIR_Profiling_Guidelines_R4).

## Dependencies

This information standard is inspired by and re-uses some materials from the international [HL7 Patient Corrections Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-patient-correction/index.html).
